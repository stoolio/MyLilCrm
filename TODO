Use const!!
Fix up functions:
  There are a couple areas where default properties should be used
  Use arrows when possible
    One line arrow don't need {} and have implicit return!
    destructuring!
  Callbacks are lame
    Promises seem like the best option and are supported in most newer browsers
Drop lodash?
  use ramda instead, try more functional programming
