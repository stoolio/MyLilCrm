Conquer Inconsistency - this one is tricky
  Naming of functions is wonky, particularly event callbacks. Decide on a format and make it happen
  Only include propTypes for props that are actually consumed by a component. More seems unecessary.
  We should really strip state out of all components, but...
  The stores are starting to become messy, in relation to function names and functionality
Use const!!
Fix up functions:
  There are a couple areas where default properties should be used
  Use arrows when possible
    One line arrow don't need {} and have implicit return!
    destructuring!
  Callbacks are lame
    this is a more structural change rather than cleanup
    Promises seem like the best option and are even supported in most newer browsers
Drop lodash?
  use ramda instead, try more functional programming
