# MyLilCrm

This is a monster of a repo, and it features both an express-mongoose powered api server (in app) and a react-react-router-reflux powered frontend in scripts.

The folders don't really make sense at this point, they happened by accident. Eventually this will get organized a bit better, or, I may break them out into separate repos and have a collection repo via git submodules.

## How do I start this thing?

You will have to install mongodb yourself. Download it from [their website](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads). If you need help [find installation instructions for your platform here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

You should, of course, have (node and npm)[https://nodejs.org/] installed on on your path.

* `git clone`
* `cd MyLilCrm`
* `npm install`

This will install all of the packages required.

There are three separate elements to run the full app.

To start everything in one fell swoop:

* `npm start`

It runs each in the background of the current shell, so you will get a jumble of the output from each.

If you want, running them each in their own terminal might be easier for debugging

You can start them separately via:

* `npm mongo`
* `npm backend`
* `npm frontend`
